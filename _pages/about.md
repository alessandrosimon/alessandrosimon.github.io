Hi, I'm a PhD student in physics and machine learning at the university of [Tübingen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iocXwnnC817yA4XHA), working with M. Oettel and G. Martius. My work focuses on the intersection of
statistical mechanics, specifically [classical fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_fluid) and machine learning methods.

Broadly speaking, we look at classical many-body systems by doing computer simulations and analyzing the results.
In parallel we try to develop theories that describe the behavior that we observed. Our tool of choice is [classical density functional theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory).
In order to find accurate functionals (i.e. make predictions) we use different machine learning methods.
